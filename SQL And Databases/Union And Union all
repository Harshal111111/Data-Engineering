UNION and UNION ALL
Understanding the SQL UNION and UNION ALL Statements
The SQL `UNION` and `UNION ALL` statements are powerful tools for combining the results of multiple SELECT queries into
a single result set. These statements are commonly used to merge data from multiple tables or retrieve distinct values
from multiple queries. In this article, we will explore the syntax, differences, and use cases of the SQL `UNION` and
`UNION ALL` statements.

The Syntax of the UNION Statement
The basic syntax of the SQL `UNION` statement is as follows:

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;

SELECT column1, column2, ...: These are the columns you want to retrieve from the tables involved in the union operation.
The columns in both SELECT queries must have compatible data types.

FROM table1: This is the first table or query from which you want to retrieve data.

UNION: This keyword combines the results of the first SELECT query with the results of the second SELECT query.

SELECT column1, column2, ...: These are the columns you want to retrieve from the second table or query. The columns
must match the structure of the first SELECT.

The Syntax of the UNION ALL Statement


The SQL `UNION ALL` statement is similar to `UNION`, but it includes duplicate rows in the result set. Its syntax is the
same as `UNION`:

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;

Unlike `UNION`, `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicate rows. It simply combines the results of both SELECT queries,
including all rows from both tables.

Differences Between UNION and UNION ALL
The primary difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` is how they handle duplicate rows:

UNION: Removes duplicate rows from the result set, providing a distinct list of values.

UNION ALL: Includes all rows from both tables, including duplicates.



Use Cases
Both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` have their use cases:

UNION: Use when you want to retrieve distinct values from multiple queries or tables.

UNION ALL: Use when you want to combine all rows from multiple queries or tables, including duplicates.

Example
Let's consider a practical example. Suppose you have two tables, `employees` and `contractors`, and you want to retrieve
a list of all unique names (first and last names) from both tables. You can use the SQL `UNION` statement for this:

    SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM contractors;

This query combines the names from both tables while removing duplicate entries.

The SQL `UNION` and `UNION ALL` statements are essential tools for merging data from multiple sources or retrieving
distinct values from multiple queries. By understanding their differences and use cases, you can efficiently manipulate
and consolidate data in your SQL queries, making them more versatile and powerful.
