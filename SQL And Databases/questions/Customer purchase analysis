In this SQL coding exercise, you will work with a database table called customer_purchases.
Your task is to write a SELECT query to analyze customer purchase data and find the top 5 customers
with the highest total purchase amounts.

You are provided with a table named customer_purchases with the following columns:

customer_id (integer) - Primary Key
