Employee Salary Analysis
Aim: Find the Highest and Lowest Salaries by Department

In this SQL coding exercise, you will work with a database table called employees.
Your task is to write a SELECT query to analyze employee salary data and find the highest and
lowest salaries for each department.



You are provided with a table named employees with the following columns:

employee_id (integer) - Primary Key

first_name (varchar(50))

last_name (varchar(50))

department (varchar(50))

salary (decimal(10, 2))



Instructions:

Write a SQL SELECT query that retrieves the following information:

Department name

Employee with the highest salary in each department (full name)

Highest salary in each department

Employee with the lowest salary in each department (full name)

The lowest salary in each department

Group the results by department name.

Sort the results in ascending order based on the department name.

WHERE
    e1.salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e1.department)
    AND e2.salary = (SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e2.department)
ORDER BY
    e1.department ASC;
