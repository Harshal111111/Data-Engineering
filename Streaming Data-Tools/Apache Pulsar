Apache Pulsar is an open-source, distributed messaging and event streaming platform designed for high-performance,
low-latency, and scalable messaging. It was initially developed by Yahoo and is now maintained by the Apache Software
Foundation. Pulsar is often compared to Apache Kafka, but it has several key differences and unique features.

Key Features of Apache Pulsar:

1. Unified Messaging Model:
   - Publish-Subscribe: Producers send messages to topics, and consumers can subscribe to receive messages from
   those topics.
   - Queueing: Supports both message queuing (like RabbitMQ) and publish-subscribe messaging (like Kafka).

2. Multitenancy:
   - Pulsar natively supports multitenancy, allowing different tenants (organizations or teams) to share the same
   Pulsar cluster while maintaining data isolation and separate access controls.

3. Distributed Architecture:
   - Pulsar is designed to be distributed across multiple machines, providing horizontal scalability and high
   availability. It separates the serving (brokers) and storage (bookies) layers, unlike Kafka, which combines them.

4. Durable Storage via Apache BookKeeper:
   - Pulsar uses Apache BookKeeper for its underlying storage, ensuring durability and data replication across multiple
   nodes. This allows for strong consistency and fault tolerance.
   - Data is stored persistently in BookKeeper and can be accessed for long-term replay and processing.

5. Geo-Replication:
   - Pulsar provides built-in support for multi-datacenter replication, allowing topics to be replicated across multiple
   geographical regions.

6. Message Delivery Guarantees:
   - At-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery semantics, providing flexibility depending on
   the application's needs.

7. Partitioned Topics:
   - Topics can be partitioned to allow horizontal scaling. Multiple consumers can read from different partitions in
   parallel for better throughput.

8. Low Latency:
   - Pulsar provides low-latency message delivery, making it suitable for real-time use cases such as event streaming,
   IoT applications, and real-time analytics.

9. Scalability:
   - Due to its separation of serving and storage, Pulsar can scale independently for both compute and storage resources
   , offering better flexibility as system loads grow.

10. Schema Registry:
   - Pulsar has a built-in schema registry for defining and enforcing data structure on topics, helping to manage and
   evolve data over time.

11. Functions and Connectors:
   - Pulsar Functions: A lightweight compute framework that allows users to process real-time data directly within
   Pulsar (similar to Kafka Streams).
   - Pulsar IO: A framework to integrate with external systems (like databases, message queues, etc.) using
    connectors.

Components of Apache Pulsar:

1. Producers: Clients that publish messages to Pulsar topics.
2. Consumers: Clients that subscribe to topics and consume messages.
3. Brokers: These handle message routing, serving requests from producers and consumers, and ensuring data
availability.
4. Bookies: These are part of Apache BookKeeper and handle the storage of messages.
5. Zookeeper: Used for metadata management, cluster configuration, and leader election (although Pulsar is moving
away from ZooKeeper for metadata management in future versions).
6. Pulsar Manager: A web-based tool to monitor and manage Pulsar clusters.

Use Cases of Apache Pulsar:

- Real-time Data Streaming: Process large volumes of real-time data, such as in IoT, monitoring systems, or
event-driven architectures.
- Messaging Systems: As a replacement for traditional message queues like RabbitMQ, supporting both queuing and
 pub-sub models.
- Data Pipelines: Used for integrating and transferring data between various systems in a robust and scalable way.
- Microservices: Facilitating communication between microservices, supporting flexible message processing and routing.
- Geo-Distributed Systems: Applications that need strong data replication across multiple data centers or regions.

Differences between Apache Pulsar and Apache Kafka:
- Architecture: Kafka combines serving and storage in brokers, whereas Pulsar separates serving (brokers) from
storage (bookies), allowing independent scaling.
- Geo-Replication: Pulsar has built-in geo-replication, while Kafka requires additional tools (like Kafka MirrorMaker).
- Message Queuing: Pulsar supports both queueing and publish-subscribe natively, whereas Kafka is focused on
the publish-subscribe model.
- Storage: Pulsar uses Apache BookKeeper for highly durable, log-structured storage.

Conclusion:
Apache Pulsar is a versatile platform for messaging and event streaming, offering features like multi-tenancy,
geo-replication, and the ability to scale serving and storage independently. It's suited for real-time data processing,
large-scale event streaming, and messaging systems that require flexibility and scalability.
