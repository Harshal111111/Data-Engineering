Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed event streaming platform primarily used for building real-time data
pipelines and streaming applications. It was developed by LinkedIn and is now maintained by the Apache Software
Foundation.

Key Features of Apache Kafka:
1.Event Streaming: Kafka enables real-time processing of events (or messages), making it ideal for applications that
require low-latency data processing.

2.Distributed Architecture: Kafka runs as a distributed system, meaning it can scale across multiple machines, ensuring
high availability and fault tolerance.

3.Publish-Subscribe Messaging System: Kafka works as a high-throughput messaging system where:
   -Producers publish (send) messages to topics.
   -Consumers subscribe to topics to read messages.

4.Topics and Partitions: Messages are written to topics, which are further divided into partitions. Partitions allow
parallelism, as multiple consumers can read from different partitions simultaneously.

5.Durability: Kafka provides data durability through message replication across multiple brokers, meaning messages are
safely stored and wonâ€™t be lost even in the case of server failure.

6.Fault-Tolerant: Kafka is designed to handle hardware or network failures seamlessly, ensuring that data streams are
not interrupted.

7.Horizontal Scalability: Kafka can handle a large volume of data, making it highly scalable. You can increase capacity
by adding more nodes to the cluster without downtime.

Common Use Cases of Kafka:
-Real-time Analytics: Processing real-time data for monitoring, predictive analytics, or business intelligence.
-Log Aggregation: Collecting and storing logs from different systems for centralized processing.
-Data Integration: Serving as a message broker for integrating various systems and transporting data between different
applications.
-Stream Processing: Kafka Streams API allows developers to build streaming applications to process events in real-time.
-Event Sourcing: Storing a series of state-changing events (useful for microservices architectures).

Components of Kafka:
1.Producers: Send data (messages) to Kafka topics.
2.Consumers: Read data from Kafka topics.
3.Brokers: Kafka servers that manage data and handle producer/consumer requests.
4.ZooKeeper: Manages cluster metadata, leader election, and configuration. (Note: Newer versions of Kafka are moving
away from ZooKeeper with KRaft mode.)

Kafka is widely used in industries like finance, retail, healthcare, and more due to its high performance and
flexibility in handling data streams.
